        <h4>My Page, the Beginning</h4>
        <p>I took some time to research how to make bullet points as a hierarchical layout within HTML; I aim to have the left-hand table of contents follow the user as they scroll down the page through each assignment. Clicking the links will advance them to that specific point. I will eventually migrate the site to GitHub, as I have used it before for previous classes. I am currently in a time crunch to accomplish the assignment due to deployment requirements, and GitHub was forcing me to change my password but also not allowing me to pass the Captcha check to do so. I will continue to troubleshoot and migrate my site to GitHub this week.</p>
        <p>The following steps hopefully include learning to create a margin on the left-hand side that will move up and down with the user as they scroll through the page, much like the table of contents does on a standard Wikipedia page. For the assignments with forms, I have not decided whether to embed them in the main page or create links to them individually. I hope that as I progress through the course, I learn the ups and downs of each option. The page has a fundamental CSS style with very little modification. I want to modernize it and allow for soft borders and 3-dimensional aspects. </p>

        <h4>Part 1 - Who is Kyle?</h4>
        <p>I am 37 years old and have been in the United States Air Force for 17 years, working in aircraft maintenance. I currently live in Hawaii and plan to stay there until I retire and further into the future. I have two kids who live in Georgia with their mother, Konnor (8) and Lillian (6); they, along with my fiancé and her son, make up my entire world and universe. The first picture is a collage of photos of my kids and myself; the next is me and my wonderful fiancé and love of my life, April. The last photo is all of us together as a family. We don&apos;t often get together with all 5 of us, but when we do, it&apos;s always some of the best days of my life.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/Unit2/kids.jpg" alt="Kyle, Konnor, and Lily">
            <img src="/Unit2/us.jpg" alt="Kyle and April">
            <img src="/Unit2/family.jpg" alt="Kyle, April, Ryder, Konnor and Lily">
        </div>
        <p>My two favorite hobbies are golf and video games. Although I am not great at either, I enjoy both thoroughly. While home in Hawaii, I try to go out to golf at least every other weekend. Because Hawaii is a paradise, I get to do it year-round! There are rarely weekends when the weather is so terrible that I don&apos;t get to golf. One of my favorite things to do is golf with April; every time we are together, we try to get at least a round (or two) in! When the weather does not permit, or I need a slow and low-key weekend, you can find me on my PC, playing video games with my best friend, Devin. </p>
        <p>Some of my favorite websites to visit are:</p>
        <div class="favorite-websites">
            <div class="website">
                <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> I spend plenty of spare time scrolling through reddit and exploring subreddits that interest me.
            </div>
            <div class="website">
                <a href="http://www.steamcommunity.com">Steam</a> Where I find great video games and deals for PC!
            </div>
            <div class="website">
                <a href="http://www.puakeagolf.com">Pueakea Golf course</a> This is one of me and my fiancé's favorite courses to play on Kauai.
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I think the next step for my website is to start working with CSS and create something more appealing to the eye. I want to work with a sleek and modernized look, not like an old Facebook page. I have not decided on a color palette yet, but it will probably be something rather simple, maybe some pastel-type colors.</p>

        <p>For Part 2, I created a form that allows you to select a set of rental clubs and a pickup time for them</p>

        <h4>Part 1 - Webpage Design</h4>
        <p>My website will be twofold; the first is a step-by-step course walkthrough, with each assignment and unit posted. It will also have information and media about Golf. The description of the pages is as follows:</p>
        <div class="unit-list-style">
            <div class="unit-item">
                <b>Page 1</b> — The index and landing page are outlined in the mockup. They will include the text and information pertaining to this course. Each assignment will be posted within the correct section.
            </div>
            <div class="unit-item">
                <b>Page 2</b> — Image page: this will include a collage of images from different golf courses I have played at.
            </div>
            <div class="unit-item">
                <b>Page 3</b> — Multimedia Page: This will have videos about golfing and tips on improving your game and swing by some of my favorite YouTubers.
            </div>
            <div class="unit-item">
                <b>Page 4</b> — Links Page: This will include links to different websites related to golf. It will include some of my favorite courses and links to websites for purchasing golf equipment.
            </div>
            <div class="unit-item">
                <b>Page 5</b> — User Design page. This will have a link to the layout mockup.
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>My next major step is creating a CSS build for my page to include my chosen color pallet and the “unit in a box” feel I want. I want the landing page to feel like a bulletin board, with each unit and section in an individual box. I will continue to build the page based on the requirements of the course, adding a section for each unit as it progresses. I also plan to make each form an individual form so that the progress of forms can be viewed while exploring the page. I may add screenshots at each breaking point to show the site's development over time.</p>

        <h4>Part 1 - The Guide</h4>
        <p>Ever thought it might be fun to chase the world's hardest-to-find ball around 6,600 yards of beautiful fields, trees, ponds, and sand “features” for four hours in the sun, rain, wind, sleet, and snow? Well, you might like to try golf! In case you do, Rick Shiels developed a short course on YouTube to walk new players (and old) through a step-by-step guide on how to swing a golf club. It is very informative, and even the most seasoned weekend warriors can glean a tidbit from Mr. Shiels.

        <p>The website is almost done! At least I’m rounding the corner on completion at this point. I think I like the CSS layout for now, it has a modern and sleek feel to it. Next will be incorporating the final design document, and a page filled with links. I am not sure exactly how I want to do the links page; maybe make it a table of contents style or directory to get to each page and the links to the outside pages/videos. </p>
